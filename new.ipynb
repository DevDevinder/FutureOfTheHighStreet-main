    "## 📌 **What the Notebook Can Do**\n",
    "This notebook currently does three things:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Displays Boundaries** such as **commercial centers, the city center**, and the **Dundee city** boundary itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Displays the Postcodes** of **Dundee city**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Displays Heatmaps** of **affluence, population densities,** or **household densities**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Displays Transport Routes** and **Travel Times** to chosen destinations, \n",
    "\n",
    "- **CCTV Data** *(in development)*\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🏗️ **What Are Cells?**\n",
    "The notebook consists of \"**cells**\" which are the parts in the notebook that have a **play button** `▶` on the top left corner.  \n",
    "Inside these cells are **blocks of code** that perform specific tasks such as those listed above.  \n",
    "\n",
    "> 🔹 *Sometimes the play button is a number in square brackets, looking something like this:* `[1]`  \n",
    "> 🔹 *Don’t worry if it appears like that it will revert back to a play button when you hover over it.*\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔄 **Running Cells in Order**\n",
    "Typically, we need to run cells **in a top-to-bottom order**, because **information gets passed between them**.  \n",
    "An example scenario to understand this is if there are two cells (A and B), and each of these cells does one specific task:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **A:** Loads Dundee’s postcodes  \n",
    "- **B:** Displays Dundee’s postcodes  \n",
    "\n",
    "📌 **If you try running Cell B before running Cell A, you will receive an error**  \n",
    "This happens because Cell B **expects postcodes to be already loaded** before displaying them.\n",
    "\n",
    "*This notebook will try to minimise the number of cells that need to interact with each other so you can focus on the sections you want, however you will always need to atleast run the first cell in the set up section*\n",
    "\n",
    "### ▶ **How to Run a Cell**\n",
    "- **Click the ▶ (Play Button)** on the top left side of the cell.  \n",
    "- **Or, click inside the cell and press `Shift + Enter`** on your keyboard.\n",
    "\n",
    " *Tip: If you collaps a section and then press the run button of that section it will run all the collapsed cells in order.*\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Getting Started**\n",
    "To use any section of the notebook, **first run the cell in Section 1** `\"Set Up Environment\"` atleast once.\n",
    "\n",
    "This will **load and connect all the necessary components** for the notebook to work.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once this cell runs, a **dropdown menu** will appear below it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔹 **Selecting the City Dataset**\n",
    "- The dropdown allows you to **choose which city's dataset to work on** *(currently, only Dundee is available)*.  \n",
    "- **Changing the city** will update the dataset that this notebook will use.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ⚠️ **Troubleshooting**\n",
    "\n",
    "📌*if you have issues scroling the page due to interacting with the map or outputs are quite large, you can use the scroll bar on the far right of the page. Also there should be an inner scrollbar for some outputs that may show up when hovering over an output incase some get hidden due to auto scrolling*\n",
    "\n",
    "*alternatively you can click the button beside the restart button that says \"Clear All Outputs\" this should clear all the outputs  you can re-display outputs by re-running the cell or choosing the same option to show output again.*\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If you **encounter unexpected errors**, try the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "🔹 Press the restart button at the top of the notebook,  *it should look like this*:  **`⟳ Restart`**  \n",
    "This **restarts the notebook** which should fix most common issues.  \n",
    " **Don’t forget to re-run the necessary setup cells afterward, especially the \"Set Up Environment\" cell**  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "📌 *If a section still isn’t working, try the following:*\n",
    "- Try giving time for things to load / process after clicking run or on ui elements\n",
    "- Double check that you have run all required cells before it.\n",
    "- Check you have chosen the correct dataset in the set up cell.\n",
    "- See bellow the cell if there are any warnings or instructions.\n",
    "- Close the notebook, clear recent cookies and then reopen the notebook alternativly try ctrl + F5 which should refresh the page and clear the cash.\n",
    "- try a different browser.\n"
