# 📘 Guide to Each Section

---

## 1. Set Up the Environment

This part prepares everything behind the scenes and lets you pick the city you want to explore.

### ✅ What to Do:
- Click the play button on the first cell.
- Wait for the dropdown menu to appear.
- Select the city (e.g. Dundee).

🎥 Example:

<video src="assets/vids/S1_cell1_Setup.mp4" controls width="600">
  Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>

---

### ✅ Check it Worked

The next cell draws a boundary of the city you selected.

🎥 Example:

<video src="assets/vids/S1_Cell2_Confirm_City.mp4" controls width="600">
  Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>

If it shows your city clearly — you're all set!

## 2. Show Postcodes on the Map

This section lets you display postcodes in specific areas:
- Within the city boundary
- In the city centre
- Around shopping districts

### ✅ What to Do:
- Run the cell
- Choose the boundary area
- Click **Accept**

⏳ It may take a little while if you're loading lots of postcodes.

🎥 Example:

<video src="assets/vids/Running_Cell_Demo.mp4" controls width="600">
  Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>

## 🔧 Common Problems

| Problem | Solution |
|--------|----------|
| ❌ Nothing happens | Go back and run the first setup cell |
| ❌ Error like `not defined` | You likely missed a cell — run things top to bottom |
| ❌ Map doesn’t appear | Try running the same cell again |
| ❌ Route doesn’t work | Try a different postcode pair |

## ❓ FAQs

**Do I need internet?**  
Yes — the map data loads from online sources.

**Can I break anything?**  
Nope! You can always restart and re-run things.

**Do I have to go in order?**  
Yes — run cells from the top down, especially the setup cell.
